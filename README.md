## Project Overview

The notebook includes:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis** on a feature-based Pistachio dataset
- **Dimensionality Reduction** using PCA
- **CNN-based Image Classification** using both:
  - Custom CNN architectures (CNN1, CNN2, CNN3)
  - Pretrained CNN models for feature extraction
- Model comparison and performance evaluation

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab (recommended)
